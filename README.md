This is a game prototype/proof of concept i am working on using react, vite and electron. I studied react for some months now, but is my first time working with electron and first time not using the default vite configuration. 

Traveler Project (still looking for a name) will be a turn-based RPG with an interconected overworld. after this prototype i will maybe move to Godot or other proper game engine.

the scope of this prototype include:
    -> Map navigation
        based on interconnected points of intrest
    -> Event/Dialog trees
        choices may lead you to diferent events, etc...
    -> Combat System
        turnbased with multiple enemies. 
    -> Inventory management
        change equiped skills, armours and weapons
    -> Placeholder Graphics
        in the end i may make somethig better
    -> No optimization
        if needed, it would be done in Godot once this is finished 
    -> Run in Mac, Linux and Windows
        thats the reason for electron
